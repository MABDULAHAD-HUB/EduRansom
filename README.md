## Features
- *File Encryption*: Securely encrypt files in a specified directory using AES encryption.
- *File Decryption*: Decrypt files that have been encrypted with the corresponding key.
- *Ransom Note Display*: Notify users of the encryption and provide instructions on how to obtain the decryption key.

## Installation
For detailed installation instructions, please see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Setup Instructions

Before running the ransomware script, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. *Gmail 2-Step Verification*:
   - Enable 2-step verification on your Gmail account. This adds an extra layer of security to your account.
   - To enable it, go to your Google Account settings, navigate to the *Security* section, and follow the instructions for setting up 2-step verification.

2. *Generate App Password*:
   - After enabling 2-step verification, create an app password specifically for this project.
   - Go to the *Security* section of your Google Account.
   - Under "Signing in to Google," find "App passwords." Select it, and you may need to sign in again.
   - Choose the app (Mail) and device (Windows, macOS, etc.) for which you need the password and click *Generate*.
   - Note the generated password, as it will be used in the script.

## Decrypting Files
To decrypt files that have been previously encrypted, you can use the decryption functionality within the same src/ransomware.py script. Ensure you have the correct encryption key.
1. Open the src/ransomware.py script in a text editor.
2. Ensure you have the correct encryption key that was generated during the encryption process.
3. Run the decryption command (you may need to implement the decryption functionality within the same script)
4. Replace your_encryption_key with the actual key you received after encryption.
